# refactor-defn

<!-- (In short: What does the project do?) -->


## Synopsis

<!-- (Show off its main functions so the reader can get a basic idea) -->

## Installation

```clojure
[threatgrid/refactor-defn "unreleased"]
```

## ns organisation

<!-- (how is the project organised? Which are its public parts?) -->

## Documentation

Please browse the public namespaces, which are documented, speced and tested.

## Development

The default namespace is `dev`. Under it, `(refresh)` is available, which should give you a basic "Reloaded workflow".

> It is recommended that you use `(clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh :after 'formatting-stack.core/format!)`.
